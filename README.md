## Scripts

The `package.json` file includes several scripts to help you manage and build your project. Here is an overview of the most important scripts:

-   **build**: This script compiles your TypeScript code into JavaScript. It typically uses the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "build": "tsc"
    }
    ```

-   **start**: This script starts your application. It might run a development server or execute the compiled JavaScript code.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node dist/index.js"
    }
    ```

-   **test**: This script runs your test suite. It usually leverages a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "test": "jest"
    }
    ```

-   **lint**: This script checks your code for style and syntax issues using a linter like ESLint.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "lint": "eslint ."
    }
    ```

-   **clean**: This script removes the `dist` directory or any other build artifacts to ensure a clean build environment.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "clean": "rm -rf dist"
    }
    ```
